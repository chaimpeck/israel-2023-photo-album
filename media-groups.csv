Going to Israel,2023-06-25-20-16-00-IMG_0088,To Sabba and Safta’s!,"The trip started with heading to Sabba and Safta’s house on Sunday night, where we awaited the ride to the airport.

The light was originally supposed to be at 1am, but was delayed to 5am."
Going to Israel,2023-06-25-22-07-57-IMG_0163,Waiting for the Driver,"We spent some nice time at Sabba and Safta’s house, resting, eating, and repacking things. The driver arrived at around 11:30pm. We loaded our things and went to the airport!"
Going to Israel,2023-06-26-01-59-43-IMG_0184,Arriving at JFK,"At first, the airport driver went to the wrong terminal. It was unusually quiet and we were told that there is a different terminal to go to. Once the driver found it, there was major traffic. We finally got there at 2am, 3 hours before our flight.

The airport was very busy. Apparently there was a Birthright flight scheduled for around the same time and there was limited airport staff at the late hour.

People in the airport seemed especially tense. We had to remember that regardless of where we were in the long lines, we would all get on the same plane at the same time!

Still, it would have been nice if the kids got to sit down, but everyone did great!

Note, the various close-up pictures are courtesy of Moshe who was given a new (old) iPhone shortly before the trip."
Going to Israel,2023-06-26-01-59-43-IMG_0184,The Plane,"For some of us, this was our first plane ride in 10 years. For others, it was the first plane ride ever.

Some of us were nervous around take-off or landing, while others just sat back and enjoyed whatever was on the screen.

At this point we were all pretty tired and tried to sleep at various times throughout the flight."
Going to Israel,2023-06-26-15-35-14-IMG_1217,Arrival in Israel,"And we arrived! Now very tired, but so so happy to be in Israel. It was around 11pm Israel time when we landed, and it took us a couple of hours to go through customs and get our baggage, mostly because kids would stop in awe of various new things - just being in the airport in Israel.

We actually had a small problem when exiting where Shira Ella’s entry card was missing after being handed back to me by somebody in the airport (maybe it fell when I put it back in my bag?). The airport staff wanted us to go back and have her take a new picture, but she was sleeping. Instead, and with some insistence, they called over various people who helped get her a new entry card so we could leave without having to wake her. We appreciated how they balanced the importance of airport security with not waking a sleeping child."
Going to Israel,2023-06-26-17-22-45-IMG_1224,Greeted by a Friend,"Our friend Ben came and met us at the airport, apparently waited for us as we took our time exiting the airport, and helped carry our suitcases and helped us to get on the train to the Jerusalem.

Everything was so smooth because of his help, to which we are so grateful for wonderful friends.

We took taxis for the last leg of the journey to the hotel where "
Ir David and Kotel,2023-06-27-01-53-08-IMG_1061,Breakfast at the Hotel,"After a late night, not everyone wanted to get up. We had planned an itinerary that was supposed to include a “rest day” before touring, but forgot to count the “travel day”. Whoops.

Sabba, Safta, and Chaim got up and made it to the hotel breakfast, which was so plentiful and good, and something that we would continue to appreciate every day of this trip."
Ir David and Kotel,2023-06-27-03-04-16-IMG_5323,Leaving the Hotel,"We met our tour guide, Shimi, who was referred to us by our cousin Becky, at the hotel. He did an excellent job all around.

Upon leaving the hotel for Ir David, we saw police cars, which Shimi noted was to escort the Prime Minister somewhere, remarking on the irony of how not discreet it is to travel like that. As it turns out, our hotel was a few blocks away from the Prime Minister’s residence in Rechavia."
Ir David and Kotel,2023-06-27-03-25-34-IMG_1063,Ir David,"We headed to Ir David. While we were here before (10 years ago), we still learned new things about this area and everything that is being excavated. We also went through tunnels that were probably from the time of the Cana’anim."
Ir David and Kotel,2023-06-27-04-27-16-IMG_0262,Olive Tree,We exited the tunnels at the site of an olive tree that was hundreds of years old. We walked a little further to the kotel.
Ir David and Kotel,2023-06-27-05-19-42-IMG_5330,The Kotel,We stopped at the kotel to pray at the site that Jews have been coming for two thousand years.
Ir David and Kotel,2023-06-27-06-36-24-IMG_5340,Cardo,"We walked through the Jewish Quarter and the Cardo. We eventually exited through the Arab Shuk, where Safta bought something for her friend back in America."
Doing Things in Rechavia,2023-06-27-06-58-57-IMG_5528,Late Afternoon in Rechavia,"By now, on our first day in Israel, others were well rested enough to get up and do things. Some of us walked around the neighborhood and  found a windmill next to the hotel. Others hung out on Sabba and Safta’s balcony.

We eventually went to a playground down the road. Later, the kids played by the fountain in front of the hotel before going out for dinner at a cafe in Rechavia that Ben had showed Chaim earlier in the day.

We reflected on how amazing it is not only that we have this beautiful land of Israel to be in, but that there are flowers planted everywhere in the streets and parks and cafes and how people take such care of this precious land."
Doing Things in Rechavia,2023-06-27-13-48-06-IMG_0307,Ice Cream in Rechavia,And concluding our first day in Israel with a walk to the ice cream place that was near the hotel. All in all a wonderful first full day in Israel!
"Stalagmites, Batcave, Rockslide, Spring, and Biblical Natural History Museum",2023-06-28-00-59-31-IMG_0309,"Second Day, Our First Trip With All of Us","We started the day at around 9am with tefilla and a wonderful breakfast. Shimi met us and the tour bus awaited.

"
"Stalagmites, Batcave, Rockslide, Spring, and Biblical Natural History Museum",2023-06-28-03-00-32-IMG_0315,To the Stalactite Cave,"We traveled west to our first destination, a stalactite cave. Along the way, we saw all of the beautiful hills that surround Jerusalem."
"Stalagmites, Batcave, Rockslide, Spring, and Biblical Natural History Museum",2023-06-28-03-28-53-IMG_0056,Arriving at the Stalactite Cave,"We got to the stalactite cave area and walked down some stairs to go down the mountain. There was a small shop before the actual cave and neat to see how easily accessible this thousands-of-years-old wonder is, and yet how well-protected it is at the same time."
"Stalagmites, Batcave, Rockslide, Spring, and Biblical Natural History Museum",2023-06-28-04-06-40-IMG_0073,Stalactites and Stalagmites,"We were told to not use flash photography, so some of the pictures are blurry, but it was a surreal experience to see these giant pillars of minerals that had formed over the years into such interesting and awesome shapes."
"Stalagmites, Batcave, Rockslide, Spring, and Biblical Natural History Museum",2023-06-28-04-22-06-IMG_5548,Back to the Tour Bus,"We now went back up the stairs. Sadly, but memorably and ought to be mentioned here, this is when Safta fell. Yair had remarked that some of the steps leading up the mountain were especially smooth, and seemingly Safta stepped on one of them and fell, fracturing her shoulder. To make matters more difficult, this was just moments before Sabba and Safta were about to head off to Mitzpe Ramon to spend two nights there.

Safta resolved to continue up the steps and to still go to Mitzpe Ramon and take it moment by moment, instead of focussing on the hurt shoulder. There was a taxi next to the tour bus awaiting to take them there, and so we all walked up together and Sabba and Safta went to their taxi and we to our tour bus."
"Stalagmites, Batcave, Rockslide, Spring, and Biblical Natural History Museum",2023-06-28-05-04-31-IMG_0348,Sabba and Safta go to Mitzpe Ramon,"Sabba and Safta headed off for two nights in Mitzpe Ramon. This was to be their “vacation within the vacation”. They booked two nights at the Beresheet Hotel to spend time in the South, by the Ramon Crater. Picture from that are below, but for the rest of us, the tour continued on!"
"Stalagmites, Batcave, Rockslide, Spring, and Biblical Natural History Museum",2023-06-28-05-27-17-IMG_0351,To the Bat Cave,"The next stop was the bat cave. This involved a hike up another mountain that was a short bus ride away. This time there were no steps or gift shops along the way. And it was getting very hot.

Everybody did amazing on the ~3km hike to the cave. There were some slippery rock to climb up, but kids of all ages managed with only a little help at times.

We stopped at almost every shady spot along the way, and there were beautiful trees all around, including olive and (possibly) carob trees."
"Stalagmites, Batcave, Rockslide, Spring, and Biblical Natural History Museum",2023-06-28-06-07-26-IMG_0145,Into the Bat Cave,"We got to the actual bat cave. Now, not everybody wanted to go in. Shimi the tour guide went ahead with Moshe and Nuriya. Chaim went in with Eshka, although every time it seemed like a bat was coming to us, Eshka screamed and we ran out together. Rifka, Yair, and Shira hung out outside the bat cave.

As Eshka and Chaim inched our way further and further in, and tried talking calmly to the bats (which they seemed responsive too), they noticed that Moshe and Nuriya went with Shimi all the way to the end of the cave (at least where people can walk)! They slowly went forward and eventually met up with them as they were on their way back.

Soon after that, a large group of yeshiva kids came in with flashlights. It suddenly was not as scary, although Chaim pondered if the bats were now more scared of us. We learned that the batcave is only open the public during certain months to give the bats a break.

Most of these pictures are blurry as it was very dark in the bat cave."
"Stalagmites, Batcave, Rockslide, Spring, and Biblical Natural History Museum",2023-06-28-06-27-01-IMG_0373,The Rock Slide,"Just outside of the bat cave, there is a natural formation in the rock that happens to make for a natural slide."
"Stalagmites, Batcave, Rockslide, Spring, and Biblical Natural History Museum",2023-06-28-07-14-14-IMG_0399,Back to the Tour Bus Again,"We hiked back, this time carefully going down the mountain to make our way back to the bus for the next activity on the schedule."
"Stalagmites, Batcave, Rockslide, Spring, and Biblical Natural History Museum",2023-06-28-07-40-05-IMG_0166,And to the Wellspring,The next stop was Shimi’s home to pick up some watermelon and then visit a wellspring that is nearby.
"Stalagmites, Batcave, Rockslide, Spring, and Biblical Natural History Museum",2023-06-28-08-19-35-IMG_0174,The Wellspring,"Chaim is getting acclimated to the water. Nuriya went in to. And, by the way, the watermelon was amazing."
"Stalagmites, Batcave, Rockslide, Spring, and Biblical Natural History Museum",2023-06-28-08-54-24-IMG_0204,Next stop: The Museum of Biblical Natural History,"This was just our second day in Israel and some of us still adjusting to the jet lag in different ways, as well as doing so many new things, but we had one more thing on today’s schedule - to go to the Museum of Biblical Natural History. These are pictures of the way there."
"Stalagmites, Batcave, Rockslide, Spring, and Biblical Natural History Museum",2023-06-28-09-13-52-IMG_0220,The Museum of Biblical Natural History,Every animal at this museum is mentioned somewhere in the Tanach. Not all animals were alive.
"Stalagmites, Batcave, Rockslide, Spring, and Biblical Natural History Museum",2023-06-28-09-22-27-IMG_0409,Friends Visit,"We told the Weinstocks that we would be at the museum and so Rob and Ayelet met us there. Eshka has not seen Ayelet in almost a year since they moved to Israel, so this was a special reunion in the midst of amazing animals and such"
"Stalagmites, Batcave, Rockslide, Spring, and Biblical Natural History Museum",2023-06-28-09-38-28-IMG_0445,Petting and Holding the Animals,"We were able to pet and hold the animals (carefully), which included the snakes!"
"Stalagmites, Batcave, Rockslide, Spring, and Biblical Natural History Museum",2023-06-28-10-03-55-IMG_0488,Locusts in the Gift Shop,"On the way out, we noticed that the gift shop sells kosher locusts with an amusing sign."
"Stalagmites, Batcave, Rockslide, Spring, and Biblical Natural History Museum",2023-06-28-10-43-17-IMG_0489,Back at the Hotel,"After a day of adventure, we arrived back at the hotel at around 5:45pm for a quick recharge."
Pizza Hut and Night Roam,2023-06-28-11-38-29-IMG_0491,Recharged and Ready to Explore,"Moshe, Eshka, and Abba ventured out to Ben Yehuda Street at around 6:40pm. They stopped on the way there at a grocery store to get Israeli Kinder Eggs and chocolate to bring back."
Pizza Hut and Night Roam,2023-06-28-12-09-07-IMG_0493,King of Fries,They stopped at “King of Fries”
Pizza Hut and Night Roam,2023-06-28-12-54-26-70966406631__BBA55197-E5EA-41D1-AEE7-10508FF75D2B,Pizza Hut,"And then Pizza Hut. Being able to eat almost anywhere or even eating in a restaurant (fast food) place was a new and exciting experience for everybody. While we have several kosher amenities back in West Hartford, there is something amazing about being able to walk into a Pizza Hut and order a kosher slice of pizza."
Pizza Hut and Night Roam,2023-06-28-13-07-13-IMG_0495,Walking Back,The streets are filled with beautiful decorations.
Pizza Hut and Night Roam,2023-06-28-17-06-55-IMG_0498,Chaim in the Old City,"Later that night, after the kids went to sleep, Chaim took a walk to the Old City to visit the kotel again and daven maariv. On the way back, he stopped by the menorah outside the Hurva shul in the Jewish Quarter and took some selfies next to it and a cat.

Some fascinating info about the golden menorah can be found here: https://templeinstitute.org/history-holy-temple-menorah/

Chaim took a bus back, so he could figure out how to use buses in Jerusalem to be prepared for the next day’s adventure. He got on a bus, but did not have a Rav Kav card and was unable to setup the Moovit app, but the driver literally just gave him a Rav Kav card with money already on it. He tried to refuse, but the driver insisted."
Mitzpe Ramon,2023-06-28-06-47-44-IMG_1237,Sabba and Safta in Mitzpe Ramon,"The following pictures are from Sabba and Safta’s visit to Miztpe Ramon. Safta said about her hurt shoulder that there is nothing that she can do about it, so she might as well just appreciate every moment of being in this beautiful place.

It also happened that Sabba left his camera in the taxi (which we got back the following week), so there are not many pictures. But, here they are, starting with, apparently, a picture of a McDonalds that was on the way there?"
Monster Slide and Pasta Basta,2023-06-29-05-21-00-IMG_5557,Meanwhile…,"For the rest of the crew, it was a new morning in Jerusalem and we had a late start with no official tours scheduled. Instead, the plan for the day was to find the famous “Monster Slide” that we vaguely remember going to 10 years ago, although possibly confused with a video of watching Jason and Jen at that very slide back in 1978.

The early afternoon started with running into a friend on the street!"
Monster Slide and Pasta Basta,2023-06-29-07-31-57-IMG_0507,Bus ride to the slide,Some excitement about taking a city bus in Jerusalem
Monster Slide and Pasta Basta,2023-06-29-07-53-59-IMG_0510,The Monster Slide,"And here we are at the Monster Slide. As noted above, this was the same slide that Sabba and Safta went to with Jason and Jenn, back in 1978. In fact, here is a link to a video of that, in the part that shows them there: https://youtu.be/GgLQchcvP7M?t=1192

While Sabba and Safta were in Mitzpe Ramon this time around, and missed this visit to the Monster Slide, it seems like that at least experienced it back in 1978."
Monster Slide and Pasta Basta,2023-06-29-10-47-50-IMG_0523,Pasta Basta,"Next, we went to Ben Yehuda Street for lunch. Yair wanted to stay back to the hotel, so we dropped him off, since we inadvertently ended up taking a bus stop that was adjacent to the hotel anyway. After that, Chaim wanted to lead everyone else on a trip through the Mamilla Mall and to the Kotel, stopping for food along the way.

Unfortunately, Chaim was still getting his sense of direction in Jerusalem and didn’t look at Google Maps, so we ended up walking in circles, but was really nice passing by everything that was going on. Eventually the kids were hungry, so we stopped at Pasta Basta and brought lunch back for Yair."
Thursday Night in Jerusalem,2023-06-29-12-58-27-IMG_0524,Staying In,"Towards the end of a less trip-focused, more grounded third day in Jerusalem, some decided to stay in and enjoy the Kinder Eggs from the previous evening."
Thursday Night in Jerusalem,2023-06-29-15-24-03-IMG_0527,Venturing Out,"Moshe however decided that he wants to work on his Scratch project, to which Abba said that he should do it in some public internet place that is “out”. And so Abba and Moshe ventured to Ben Yehuda to find public internet. They stopped at Big Apple Pizza and ate, but alas no internet there. So, they found a spot outside on the busy streets. "
Thursday Night in Jerusalem,2023-06-29-16-13-42-IMG_0538,Climbing,"Moshe enjoyed climbing on the various things along the streets. Wherever we would walk, he found find ledges and such to walk along."
Thursday Night in Jerusalem,2023-06-29-17-17-58-IMG_0542,Chaim’s Second Night Roam,"After the kids were settled, Chaim went back out to go daven Ma’ariv at the kotel again. And again he got a little lost, but this time built up his mental map of Jerusalem and where different streets lead and converge. And so, on the way there, he past by the Montefiore Windmill, which is technically not on the way."
Thursday Night in Jerusalem,2023-06-29-17-43-00-IMG_0544,The Kotel at 12:45am,"Upon reaching the kotel at 12:45am, there was a large group singing and dancing. Chaim spent some time there and then went back to the hotel to rest up for the next day of activity and Erev Shabbat in Jerusalem."
Botanical Gardens and Erev Shabbat,2023-06-30-02-37-52-IMG_0546,Friday Morning in Jerusalem,The day started with another wonderful breakfast and then Abba and Shira went to the playground.
Botanical Gardens and Erev Shabbat,2023-06-30-06-28-36-IMG_0551,To the Botanical Gardens,"After everybody got ready, we ventured out to the Botanical Gardens in Jerusalem. We walked there and had some trouble finding the entrance with a stroller, due to some nearby construction, but once we found it, the kids stopped to rest."
Botanical Gardens and Erev Shabbat,2023-06-30-07-21-34-IMG_0400,Quick Stop for Lunch,"Before actually going into the garden, we stopped for lunch at a nearby cafe, noting that things were closing early for Shabbat and that the kids were getting hungry."
Botanical Gardens and Erev Shabbat,2023-06-30-07-47-30-IMG_1271,"Meanwhile, Sabba and Safta were Arriving Back in Jerusalem",They stopped at Terem to look at Safta’s shoulder. It turned out it was fractured after an x-ray. They gave Safta a sling and some instructions to come back in a week.
Botanical Gardens and Erev Shabbat,2023-06-30-07-54-36-IMG_0422,The Lily Pads,"We were now ready to enter the garden, but first stopping to look at the lily pads and a frog."
Botanical Gardens and Erev Shabbat,2023-06-30-07-59-24-IMG_0429,The Garden,"Ok, to the garden. Moshe apparently took random pictures of everyone’s feet, and a cat."
Botanical Gardens and Erev Shabbat,2023-06-30-08-38-33-IMG_0481,Pine Cone Bowling,The kids did bowling with a pine cone.
Botanical Gardens and Erev Shabbat,2023-06-30-09-28-36-IMG_0575,Taking the Bus Back,"We took the bus back to the hotel, since everyone was tired and Abba did not want to push the stroller up hill."
Botanical Gardens and Erev Shabbat,2023-06-30-09-49-56-IMG_0580,Back at the Hotel,We took a break at the fountain outside the hotel before going in.
Botanical Gardens and Erev Shabbat,2023-06-30-09-57-15-IMG_0588,Sabba and Safta are Back and Shabbat is Coming,"We arrived back to get ready for Shabbat and were greeted by Sabba and Safta who were getting ready as well.

We do not have pictures of course, but Shabbat in the hotel with all of us together was such a wonderful experience. The food was really good, but it just felt so special to be in Jerusalem together around the table making kiddush and in room with so many families and groups doing the same.

On Friday night after the meal, some of us walked to the Old City to try to visit Binyonim Sheis and then to the kotel. We could not find where Binyonim was staying, but proceeded on to the kotel, which was the first time for Nuriya and Shira, and the first time this visit for Rifka, Eshka, and Moshe.

As we learned, the Old City is not easy to get around with a stroller, but some yeshiva bachorim helped with at least one set of stairs.

We had a wonderful Friday night at the kotel.

Afterwards, Chaim went to visit Ben at Sora’s apartment and they played games up 4:30am.

The next morning, some of us slept in a little, still getting over jet lag and catching up on sleep, but we all eventually made it to daven at our various paces and then to do kiddush at around 2pm. Again, the food was wonderful and so great being all together.

Later in the afternoon, Chaim, Rifka, and Eshka headed off to visit the Rothman’s in Nachlaot. They went up the seven flights of stairs to their apartment and hung out with them on the room of their building eating watermelon and having meaningful conversation.

Afterwards, some of us went to visit Ben to play games, and by the end of Shabbat, Chaim, Rifka, Yair, Moshe, and Eshka were all at Sora’s apartment hanging out, and we made havdallah there, led by Sora’s father, while Sabba, Safta, Nuriya, and Shira hung out at the hotel."
Motzei Shabbat Protests,2023-07-01-15-28-30-IMG_1110,Protests,"Happening in the backdrop of our trip to Israel were protests about the Judicial Reform. Being that our hotel was in Rechavia, just a couple blocks away from the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s residence, and being at a major intersection, it was apparently also a hot spot for political activism. As such, there were protests on the street right outside the hotel, near the fountain. And so was the start of our second week in Israel."
