Going to Israel,2023-06-25-20-16-00-IMG_0088,To Sabba and Safta’s!,TODO: Description of TO Sabba and Safta's,,,
Going to Israel,2023-06-25-22-07-57-IMG_0163,Waiting for the Driver,"We spent some nice time at Sabba and Safta’s house, resting, eating, and repacking things. The driver arrived at around 11:30pm. We loaded our things and went to the airport!",,,
Going to Israel,2023-06-26-01-59-43-IMG_0184,Arriving at JFK,"At first, the airport driver went to the wrong terminal. It was unusually quiet and we were told that there is a different terminal to go to. Once the driver found it, there was major traffic. We finally got there at 2am, 3 hours before our flight.

The airport was very busy. Apparently there was a Birthright flight scheduled for around the same time and there was limited airport staff at the late hour.

People in the airport seemed especially tense. We had to remember that regardless of where we were in the long lines, we would all get on the same plane at the same time!

Still, it would have been nice if the kids got to sit down, but everyone did great!

Going to Israel,2023-06-26-01-59-43-IMG_0184,The Plane,"For some of us, this was our first plane ride in 10 years. For others, it was the first plane ride ever.

Some of us were nervous around take-off or landing, while others just sat back and enjoyed whatever was on the screen.

At this point we were all pretty tired and tried to sleep at various times throughout the flight.",,,
Going to Israel,2023-06-26-15-35-14-IMG_1217,Arrival in Israel,"And we arrived! Now very tired, but so so happy to be in Israel. It was around 11pm Israel time when we landed, and it took us a couple of hours to go through customs and get our baggage, mostly because kids would stop in awe of various new things - just being in the airport in Israel.

We actually had a small problem when exiting where Shira Ella’s entry card was missing after being handed back to me by somebody in the airport (maybe it fell when I put it back in my bag?). The airport staff wanted us to go back and have her take a new picture, but she was sleeping. Instead, and with some insistence, they called over various people who helped get her a new entry card so we could leave without having to wake her. We appreciated how they balanced the importance of airport security with not waking a sleeping child.",,,
Going to Israel,2023-06-26-17-22-45-IMG_1224,Greeted by a Friend,"Our friend Ben came and met us at the airport, apparently waited for us as we took our time exiting the airport, and helped carry our suitcases and helped us to get on the train to the Jerusalem.

Everything was so smooth because of his help, to which we are so grateful for wonderful friends.

We took taxis for the last leg of the journey to the hotel where ",,,
Ir David and Kotel,2023-06-27-01-53-08-IMG_1061,Breakfast at the Hotel,"After a late night, not everyone wanted to get up. We had planned an itinerary that was supposed to include a “rest day” before touring, but forgot to count the “travel day”. Whoops.

Sabba, Safta, and Chaim got up and made it to the hotel breakfast, which was so plentiful and good, and something that we would continue to appreciate every day of this trip.",,,
Ir David and Kotel,2023-06-27-03-04-16-IMG_5323,Leaving the Hotel,"We met our tour guide, Shimi, who was referred to us by our cousin Becky, at the hotel. He did an excellent job all around.

Upon leaving the hotel for Ir David, we saw police cars, which Shimi noted was to escort the Prime Minister somewhere, remarking on the irony of how not discreet it is to travel like that. As it turns out, our hotel was a few blocks away from the Prime Minister’s residence in Rechavia.",,,
Ir David and Kotel,2023-06-27-03-25-34-IMG_1063,Ir David,"We headed to Ir David. While we were here before (10 years ago), we still learned new things about this area and everything that is being excavated. We also went through tunnels that were probably from the time of the Cana’anim.",,,
Ir David and Kotel,2023-06-27-04-27-16-IMG_0262,Olive Tree,We exited the tunnels at the site of an olive tree that was hundreds of years old. We walked a little further to the kotel.,,,
Ir David and Kotel,2023-06-27-05-19-42-IMG_5330,The Kotel,We stopped at the kotel to pray at the site that Jews have been coming for two thousand years.,,,
Ir David and Kotel,2023-06-27-06-36-24-IMG_5340,Cardo,"We walked through the Jewish Quarter and the Cardo. We eventually exited through the Arab Shuk, where Safta bought something for her friend back in America.",,,
Doing Things in Rechavia,2023-06-27-06-58-57-IMG_5528,Late Afternoon in Rechavia,"By now, on our first day in Israel, others were well rested enough to get up and do things. Some of us walked around the neighborhood and  found a windmill next to the hotel. Others hung out on Sabba and Safta’s balcony.

We eventually went to a playground down the road. Later, the kids played by the fountain in front of the hotel before going out for dinner at a cafe in Rechavia that Ben had showed Chaim earlier in the day.",,,
Doing Things in Rechavia,2023-06-27-13-48-06-IMG_0307,Ice Cream in Rechavia,And concluding our first day in Israel with a walk to the ice cream place that was near the hotel. All in all a wonderful first full day in Israel!,,,

We traveled west to our first destination, a stalactite cave.",,,
