Apparently there was a Birthright flight scheduled for around the same time and there was limited airport staff at the late hour.\n\nPeople in the airport seemed especially tense. We had to remember that regardless of where we were in the long lines, we would all get on the same plane at the same time!\n\nStill, it would have been nice if the kids got to sit down, but everyone did great!\n\nNote, the various close-up pictures are courtesy of Moshe who was given a new (old) iPhone shortly before the trip.",

The airport staff wanted us to go back and have her take a new picture, but she was sleeping. Instead, and with some insistence, they called over various people who helped get her a new entry card so we could leave without having to wake her. We appreciated how they balanced the importance of airport security with not waking a sleeping child.",

To make matters more difficult, this was just moments before Sabba and Safta were about to head off to Mitzpe Ramon to spend two nights there.\n\nSafta resolved to continue up the steps and to still go to Mitzpe Ramon and take it moment by moment, instead of focussing on the hurt shoulder. There was a taxi next to the tour bus awaiting to take them there, and so we all walked up together and Sabba and Safta went to their taxi and we to our tour bus.",

Rifka, Yair, and Shira hung out outside the bat cave.\n\nAs Eshka and Chaim inched our way further and further in, and tried talking calmly to the bats (which they seemed responsive too), they noticed that Moshe and Nuriya went with Shimi all the way to the end of the cave (at least where people can walk)! They slowly went forward and eventually met up with them as they were on their way back.\n\nSoon after that, a large group of yeshiva kids came in with flashlights. It suddenly was not as scary, although Chaim pondered if the bats were now more scared of us. We learned that the batcave is only open the public during certain months to give the bats a break.\n\nMost of these pictures are blurry as it was very dark in the bat cave.",

The food was really good, but it just felt so special to be in Jerusalem together around the table making kiddush and in room with so many families and groups doing the same.\n\nOn Friday night after the meal, some of us walked to the Old City to try to visit Binyonim Sheis and then to the kotel. We could not find where Binyonim was staying, but proceeded on to the kotel, which was the first time for Nuriya and Shira, and the first time this visit for Rifka, Eshka, and Moshe.\n\nAs we learned, the Old City is not easy to get around with a stroller, but some yeshiva bachorim helped with at least one set of stairs.\n\nWe had a wonderful Friday night at the kotel.\n\nAfterwards, Chaim went to visit Ben at Sora\u2019s apartment and they played games up 4:30am.\n\nThe next morning, some of us slept in a little, still getting over jet lag and catching up on sleep, but we all eventually made it to daven at our various paces and then to do kiddush at around 2pm. Again, the food was wonderful and so great being all together.\n\nLater in the afternoon, Chaim, Rifka, and Eshka headed off to visit the Rothman\u2019s in Nachlaot. They went up the seven flights of stairs to their apartment and hung out with them on the room of their building eating watermelon and having meaningful conversation.\n\nAfterwards, some of us went to visit Ben to play games, and by the end of Shabbat, Chaim, Rifka, Yair, Moshe, and Eshka were all at Sora\u2019s apartment hanging out, and we made havdallah there, led by Sora\u2019s father, while Sabba, Safta, Nuriya, and Shira hung out at the hotel.",

That was upgraded and now you can go in it and there is a whole miniature city connected by train tracks and model trains in it. There also seemed to be some new (well not new, but newly placed) amusement rides. We had burgers and (surprise!) birthday cake, and the kids went on various rides. We also shopped in the little gift shops and there were some interestingly translated items.\n\nWe also went to two places that we remember from 10 years ago that were still there: The puzzle store, where we purchased some wooden puzzles, and Rebar, the juice bar.",

It was around 11pm Israel time when we landed, and it took us a couple of hours to go through customs and get our baggage, mostly because kids would stop in awe of various new things - just being in the airport in Israel.\n\nWe actually had a small problem when exiting where Shira Ella\u2019s entry card was missing after being handed back to me by somebody in the airport (maybe it fell when I put it back in my bag?). The airport staff wanted us to go back and have her take a new picture, but she was sleeping. Instead, and with some insistence, they called over various people who helped get her a new entry card so we could leave without having to wake her. We appreciated how they balanced the importance of airport security with not waking a sleeping child.",

Others hung out on Sabba and Safta\u2019s balcony.\n\nWe eventually went to a playground down the road. Later, the kids played by the fountain in front of the hotel before going out for dinner at a cafe in Rechavia that Ben had showed Chaim earlier in the day.\n\nWe reflected on how amazing it is not only that we have this beautiful land of Israel to be in, but that there are flowers planted everywhere in the streets and parks and cafes and how people take such care of this precious land.",

Yair had remarked that some of the steps leading up the mountain were especially smooth, and seemingly Safta stepped on one of them and fell, fracturing her shoulder. To make matters more difficult, this was just moments before Sabba and Safta were about to head off to Mitzpe Ramon to spend two nights there.\n\nSafta resolved to continue up the steps and to still go to Mitzpe Ramon and take it moment by moment, instead of focussing on the hurt shoulder. There was a taxi next to the tour bus awaiting to take them there, and so we all walked up together and Sabba and Safta went to their taxi and we to our tour bus.",

Chaim went in with Eshka, although every time it seemed like a bat was coming to us, Eshka screamed and we ran out together. Rifka, Yair, and Shira hung out outside the bat cave.\n\nAs Eshka and Chaim inched our way further and further in, and tried talking calmly to the bats (which they seemed responsive too), they noticed that Moshe and Nuriya went with Shimi all the way to the end of the cave (at least where people can walk)! They slowly went forward and eventually met up with them as they were on their way back.\n\nSoon after that, a large group of yeshiva kids came in with flashlights. It suddenly was not as scary, although Chaim pondered if the bats were now more scared of us. We learned that the batcave is only open the public during certain months to give the bats a break.\n\nMost of these pictures are blurry as it was very dark in the bat cave.",

He got on a bus, but did not have a Rav Kav card and was unable to setup the Moovit app, but the driver literally just gave him a Rav Kav card with money already on it.

      "description": "We arrived back to get ready for Shabbat and were greeted by Sabba and Safta who were getting ready as well.\n\nWe do not have pictures of course, but Shabbat in the hotel with all of us together was such a wonderful experience. The food was really good, but it just felt so special to be in Jerusalem together around the table making kiddush and in room with so many families and groups doing the same.\n\nOn Friday night after the meal, some of us walked to the Old City to try to visit Binyonim Sheis and then to the kotel. We could not find where Binyonim was staying, but proceeded on to the kotel, which was the first time for Nuriya and Shira, and the first time this visit for Rifka, Eshka, and Moshe.\n\nAs we learned, the Old City is not easy to get around with a stroller, but some yeshiva bachorim helped with at least one set of stairs.\n\nWe had a wonderful Friday night at the kotel.\n\nAfterwards, Chaim went to visit Ben at Sora\u2019s apartment and they played games up 4:30am.\n\nThe next morning, some of us slept in a little, still getting over jet lag and catching up on sleep, but we all eventually made it to daven at our various paces and then to do kiddush at around 2pm. Again, the food was wonderful and so great being all together.\n\nLater in the afternoon, Chaim, Rifka, and Eshka headed off to visit the Rothman\u2019s in Nachlaot. They went up the seven flights of stairs to their apartment and hung out with them on the room of their building eating watermelon and having meaningful conversation.\n\nAfterwards, some of us went to visit Ben to play games, and by the end of Shabbat, Chaim, Rifka, Yair, Moshe, and Eshka were all at Sora\u2019s apartment hanging out, and we made havdallah there, led by Sora\u2019s father, while Sabba, Safta, Nuriya, and Shira hung out at the hotel.",

      "description": "And then we went to First Station. We were here 10 years ago (not all of us), and there seemed to be more things. For example, there was an old train car that Yair and Moshe (and possibly Eshka) played around 10 years ago. That was upgraded and now you can go in it and there is a whole miniature city connected by train tracks and model trains in it. There also seemed to be some new (well not new, but newly placed) amusement rides. We had burgers and (surprise!) birthday cake, and the kids went on various rides. We also shopped in the little gift shops and there were some interestingly translated items.\n\nWe also went to two places that we remember from 10 years ago that were still there: The puzzle store, where we purchased some wooden puzzles, and Rebar, the juice bar.",
